# Model Folder

Place your downloaded TensorFlow detection model here.

Recommended:
- [SSD MobileNet V2 (COCO)](http://download.tensorflow.org/models/object_detection/ssd_mobilenet_v2_fpnlite_320x320_coco17_tpu-8.tar.gz)

After downloading, extract it here so that the path looks like:

model/ssd_mobilenet_v2_fpnlite_320x320/saved_model/


The detection script in `app/main.py` expects this folder structure.
